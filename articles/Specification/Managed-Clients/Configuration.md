# Configuration
Management runtime is configurable using registry values specified in the registry key:
`HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd`  
Registry values are configured via GPO or DSC, or can be configured by any other means that can keep registry configuration in place.

Currently the following configuration values are supported:  
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="27%">Value</th>
<th width="17%">Type</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

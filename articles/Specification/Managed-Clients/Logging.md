# Logging
Management runtime logs all events in Application Event Log of local computer. Log messages are English only, but can be localized or additional language can be added, if necessary, in the future.

Type of events that are logged is configurable either via GPO or via the following registry `REG_DWORD` value:  
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D-087DE603E3EA}\ExtensionDebugLevel`

*Note*: This registry value takes precedence over Logging level registry policy - see [Configuration](Configuration.md) section for details

Semantic of possible values is as follows:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="11%">Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Silent mode; log errors only.  

When no error occurs, no information is logged about management runtime activity  

This is a default value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Log Errors and warnings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Verbose mode, log everything</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Event source for all events reported by management runtime is always **AdmPwd**.  
The following table summarizes the events that can occur in the Event Log:
<table>

<th width="15%">Severity</th>

*Notes*:
* Generally, all events with severity “Error” are blocking, so in case that any error occurs, no other tasks are performed and management runtime terminates its processing
* Event source for the Event Log is embedded in the same executable as main GPO executive. Reason for this decision was to make the deployment simple

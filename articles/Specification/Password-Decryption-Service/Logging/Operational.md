<td>

Could not open listener for service %1.<br/>
Error: %2<br/>
Verify that service port is not occupied by other program.<br/>
When PDS is co-hosted with DNS server, then DNS server may occupy many UDP ports including PDS UDP port used for centralized reporting. 
If this is a case, you can make the port available by the following PowerShell commands:<br/>
``` PowerShell
$Setting=Get-DnsServerSetting -All
$Setting.SocketPoolExcludedPortRanges='61184-61184'
Set-DnsServerSetting $Setting
```
</td>
<td>

Logged when PDS is not able to open listener on configured TCP or UDP port

*Notes*:
Service name can be one of following:
* **PDS**: For PDS core service that listens on 61184/tcp by default
* **CentralizedReporting**: For clientralized client reporting service that listens on 61184/udp by default

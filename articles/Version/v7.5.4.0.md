Release date: `27.12.2017`

Changes in this release:
* This release simplifies and unifies working in multiforest environments:
  * Adds method [GetSupportedForests](xref:AdmPwd.PDSUtils.PdsWrapper.GetSupportedForests(System.Boolean))
  * Removes the need for Supported Forests GPO for Administrative tools. Now all management tools take the list of forests that are supported from PDS wrapper, that in turn calls into PDS to get data. PDS takes the list of supported forests from its own configuration.

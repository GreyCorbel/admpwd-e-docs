# Installation
Basic AdmPwd.E installation and configuration consists of the following steps:
* AD schema extension
* Configuration of permissions for PDS service
* Configuration of permissions for users of solution
* Configuration of permissions for computers to report passwords to AD
* Installation of PDS
* Installation of management tools
* Configuration of GPO
* Installation of management runtime

Steps are described in more details below.

## AD schema extension
This step installs required AD Schema updates and registers new AD Extended Rights.

Required role membership:
* Schema Admin (for AD schema updates)
* Enterprise admin (for registration of Extended rights)

Schema can be extended by 2 ways:
* Via PowerShell management module
* By importing of LDF files

### PowerShell management module
This is recommended way of performing AD changes.
To perform AD updates, install PowerShell management module (from `AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.<platform>.msi`) on any Windows machine where you can log in as Schema Admin AND Enterprise Admin.

Then run the following PowerShellcommand:

`Update-AdmPwdADSchema`

Output shows details on operations performed - for bot AD schema update AND Extended Rights registration

### LDF files
This is alternate way of AD schema extension - you can use it in case that for whatever reason, AD schema extension via PowerSHell is not possible. There are 2 LDF files to be used:
* For [AD Schema changes](https://gcstoragedownload.blob.core.windows.net/download/AdmPwd.E/Schema/AdmPwd_Full.zip) - imports new attributes to AD schema and makes them available on computer and user object classes
* For [Extended Rights definition](https://gcstoragedownload.blob.core.windows.net/download/AdmPwd.E/Schema/ExtendedRights.zip) - imports new AD rights definition to AD configuration partition

Files can be imported from command line on Domain Controller by `ldifde.exe` tool:  

`ldifde -i -f AdmPwd_Full.ldf -c "cn=X" "#schemaNamingContext" -v`  
*Note*: This command requires running as Schema Admin  

`ldifde -i -f ExtendedRights.ldf -c "cn=X" "#configurationNamingContext" -v`  
*Note*: This command requires running as Enterprise Admin

## Configuration of permissions for PDS service

This step ensures that PDS service account has appropriate permissions on AD trees where managed objects are located.

By default, PDS installs under NETWORK SERVICE asccount, but can be also operated under domain account or Group Managed Service Account. Steps and command samples in this guide assume that PDS is using NETWORK SERVICE account and is running on AD member server.

Best practice is to create AD group named "PDS Servers" (or any name confirming to naming convention for your AD) and make computer accounts of servers that are planned to run PDS service a members of this group.

*Note*: If running PDS on Domain Controller only, you do not need to create the delegation group - delegate the permission to NETWORK SERVICE special account instead. This is because when process running under NETWORK SERVICE on Domain Controller accesses AD, it always chooses local AD instance and authenticates as NETWORK SERVICE rather than computer account. In this case, use "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" as value of parameter AllowedPrincipals in delegation cmdlets below.

Permissions are granted using `AdmPwd.PS` PowerShell management module. Sample script below assumes that:
* PDS delegation group name is 'PDS Servers'
* Managed machines are in AD subtree under 'ManagedMachines'
* Managed domain accounts are in AD under subtree 'AdmPwdManagedAccounts
* DNS domain name is `MyDomain.com`; NetBIOS domain name is `MYDOMAIN`

```PowerShell
# Permission to read and write ms-MCS-* attributes on computers
#Persmission to generally read object atributes (PDS reads ACL, objectClass and objectSid attributes during access control check)
Set-AdmPwdPdsPermission -Identity ManagedMachines -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\PDS Servers"

# Permission to retrieve passwords from deleted computer objects
# Note: You may need to take ownership of cn=Deleted Objects,DC=MaDomain,DC=com to be able to perform this delegation
Set-AdmPwdPdsDeletedObjectsPermission -DomainDnsName mydomain.com -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\PDS Servers"

#Permissions to read and manage password of managed domain accounts
#Persmission to generally read object atributes (PDS reads ACL, objectClass and objectSid attributes during access control check)
Set-AdmPwdPdsManagedAccountsPermission -Identity AdmPwdManagedAccounts -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\PDS Servers"

```

## Configuration of permissions for users of the solution
Solution uses newly registered Extended Rights 'Read admin password' and 'Reset admin password' to allow/deny password reads and resets. This provides ability to define security model that does not depend on built-in AD permissions.

Sample delegation script below has the following assumptions:
* Managed machines are in AD subtree under 'ManagedMachines'
* Managed domain accounts are in AD under subtree 'AdmPwdManagedAccounts
* DNS domain name is `MyDomain.com`; NetBIOS domain name is `MYDOMAIN`
* There is AD group that will be delegated the permission to read passwords: 'Password Readers'
* There is AD group tthat will be delegated the permission to reset passwords: 'Password resetters'

```PowerShell
#Delegate Read password permission for managed machines
Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission -Identity ManagedMachines -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\Password Readers"

#Delegate Reset password permission for managed machines
Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -Identity ManagedMachines -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\Password Resetters"
```

Permissions can also be delegated on individual object level. In this case, you have to use distinguishedName of object in delegation command. This is particularly useful when you want to delegate permission to use privileged personal account to standard account:

```PowerShell
#Allow mydomain\john to read password of account mydomain\john_admin
Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission -Identity "cn=john_admin,ou=AdmPwdManagedAccounts,dc=mydomain,dc=com" -AllowedPrincipals "MYDOMAIN\john"
```

## Permissions for managed computers to report passwords to AD
This makes sure that managed machines can write passwords of managed local admin accounts to attributes of own computer accounts.

```PowerShell
#Allow computer to report its own password to AD
Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission -Identity ManagedMachines
```

## Installation of PDS
PDS gets installed from `AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.<platform>.msi`. Simply run the msi package manually and select appropriate component to install. PDS installs all files to `%ProgramFiles%\AdmPwd\PDS`
Or - if you prefer unattended setup - this is command line that installs just PDS service on x64 machine:  
`Msiexec /i AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.x64.msi ADDLOCAL=PDS /q`

## Installation of management tools
Management tools that come with the solution include Fat UI client and Powershell management module.

Fat UI client is best option for task-oriented staff and allows easily read and reset password of local admin accounts on managed computers.

Powershell module implements all operations provided by solution, and (almost) complete configuration of solution.  
*Note*: Some configuration settings are performed via editing of PDS configuration file

Management tools get installed from `AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.<platform>.msi`. Simply run the msi package manually and select appropriate component to install.  
Fat client installs all files to `%Program Files%\AdmPwd\UI`; PowerShell module gets installed tomodules  standard path `$pshome\Modules\AdmPwd.PS`

If you prefer unattended installation, this is a command line that installs Fat client UI and PowerShell module on x64 machine:

`Msiexec /i AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.x64.msi ADDLOCAL=Management.PS,Management.UI /q`

## Configuration of GPO
Configuration of GPO is done using solution specific ADMX templates. Templates are installed from `AdmPwd.E.Tools.Setup.<platform>.msi` to standard folder `%SystemRoot%\PolicyDefinitions`
Install them on machine where you perform GPO management. If you use Centralized Policy Store in your organization, copy the respective files to folder that implements your Central policy store. Files are:  
```
AdmPwd.E.admx
en-US\AdmPwd.E.adml
```
Please, be aware of to enable Password Encryption feature follow these steps as prerequisites:

1. generate new encryption/decription key pair in PDS using: 
`New-AdmPwdKeyPair -KeySize 2048`  
*(Then you are able to retrieve public key to put it into GPO password encryption template)*

2. retrieve public key to your clipboard using:
`(Get-AdmPwdPublicKey -KeyId).Key | clip`

*Note*: On Windows Nano Server, GPO is not there, any you have to use PowerShell DSC or other trechnology to implement registry configuration. There is sample PowerShell DSC configuration in Windows Nano Server install package that shows possible configuration setings.

## Installation of management runtime
Installation of management runtime is dome using `AdmPwd.E.CSE.Setup.<platform>.msi` on all Windows platforms except for Windows Nano Server. On Windows Nano server, management runtime is installed from `AdmPwd.E.Client.appx` package.

Deploy installers or packages via SW distribution tool of your choice. Unattended setup command line for MSI package:  
`msiexec /i AdmPwd.E.CSE.Setup.<platform>.msi`

*Note*: Remember to set policy 'Enable local admin password management' to Enabled once you are ready and management runtime is installed. Without this policy turned on, management runtime does not start machine management.
